    Input:
          • category (string) # e.g. "quantum-ph"
          • since_days (int)  # e.g. "1" for the last 1 days since today's date.

        Task:
          1. Call the ibm-arXiv tool to search for all papers on `category` published in the last `since_days`. All the functionality is already implemented in the funciton, simply execute the function with the given parameters as the input, and then return the output (which should be titles of research papers) into a list.
          Directly print out the list in the output.

    The input will be a title to a research paper from arxiv, which we can call `title`. This will be used as a parameter for the function in step 1. 

    Step1:
    Use the get_metadata tool, passing in the given title to retreive the abstract for the paper.  The function call should just be `get_metadata_by_title(title)`. 

    Currently you are using the Thought, Result, and Reason step which is the final output that is generated. However, I want you to stop at the Result step (which should directly just be the output of the function).
    *STRICTLY output the result of the function and nothing else*

    Example output that the user should see:
    {
      "title": inputted title,
      "authors": [
          actual authors retrieved by the function
      ],
      "published": actual date retrieved by the function,
      "abstract": actual abstract retrieved by the function

    You will be given the metadata to an arxiv research paper as input, including categories like title, author, date published, and abstract. 
    Use all these input information to generate a formatted text summary. In addition to this, please add onto/extend the abstract to be more comprehensive as a whole, explaining terms, ideas, concepts that might be difficult to understand. 
    *Do not output anything other than the generated summary, and directly print it from the result step*. Make sure it follows the example output format.

    Example output:
    Title, by Authors, published date.
    Augmented abstract/summary....
